         <h1 class="recipe">Pizza:</h1>
         <br>
        <p style="color:aqua">all info:
            Ingredients:
Pizza Dough:

2 ¼ teaspoons (1 packet) active dry yeast
1 ½ cups warm water
3 ½ - 4 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon sugar
Pizza Sauce:

1 can (14 ounces) crushed tomatoes
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried basil
Salt and pepper to taste
Toppings:

Mozzarella cheese, shredded
Any additional toppings you like (pepperoni, bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, etc.)
<br>
<br>

Instructions:<br>
Prepare the Dough:

In a small bowl, dissolve the sugar in warm water, then sprinkle the yeast over the top. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.
In a large mixing bowl, combine 3 ½ cups of flour, salt, and olive oil. Pour in the yeast mixture and stir until a dough forms.
Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes, adding more flour as needed until the dough is smooth and elastic.
Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a clean towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours, or until doubled in size.
Make the Sauce:
<br>
In a saucepan, combine the crushed tomatoes, minced garlic, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Simmer over low heat for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens slightly.
Preheat the Oven:
<br>
Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while preheating.
Assemble the Pizza:
<br>
Punch down the risen dough and divide it into two equal portions. Roll out each portion into a circle or rectangle, depending on your preference, on a floured surface.
Transfer the rolled-out dough onto a pizza peel or baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
Spread a layer of the prepared pizza sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.
Sprinkle a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce, then add your desired toppings.
Bake the Pizza:
<br>
If using a pizza stone, carefully transfer the pizza onto the preheated stone in the oven. If using a baking sheet, simply place the baking sheet in the oven.
Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and melted.

<h1 class="recipe">beef:</h1>
<br>
        <p style="color:aqua;">
        <br>   
        Ingredients:<br>
1 pound beef sirloin or tenderloin, thinly sliced
Salt and pepper to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 large onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 pound mushrooms, sliced
1 cup beef broth
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1 cup sour cream
2 tablespoons flour
Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)
Egg noodles or rice, cooked according to package instructions

<br>
   
Instructions:<br>
Prepare the Beef:

Season the beef slices with salt and pepper.
In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium-high heat.
Add the beef slices and cook until browned on both sides. Remove from the skillet and set aside.
Cook the Vegetables:

In the same skillet, add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil.
Add the chopped onion and cook until softened.
Add the minced garlic and sliced mushrooms, cooking until the mushrooms are tender and the liquid has evaporated.
Make the Sauce:

Sprinkle the flour over the vegetables and stir well to coat.
Gradually add the beef broth, stirring constantly to avoid lumps.
Add Worcestershire sauce and Dijon mustard. Stir to combine.
Combine Everything:

Return the cooked beef to the skillet.
Reduce the heat to low and stir in the sour cream. Make sure not to boil the mixture after adding the sour cream to prevent curdling.
Cook for a few more minutes until everything is heated through and the sauce is thickened.
Serve:

Serve the beef stroganoff over cooked egg noodles or rice.
Garnish with freshly chopped parsley.
Tips:
For a richer flavor, you can use a bit of red wine when cooking the mushrooms.
If you prefer a thicker sauce, you can add a bit more flour or let it simmer a bit longer.
Make sure to slice the beef thinly and against the grain for the best texture.
